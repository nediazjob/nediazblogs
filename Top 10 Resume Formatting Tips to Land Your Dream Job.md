1. Keep It Concise and Focused
Hiring folks often look at resumes fast, so try to keep yours to one page. If you have a lot of years of work (over 10 years), two pages might be okay. Stick to skills, things you've done, and wins that fit the job you want.
2. Use a Clean, Professional Layout
Go for a clean layout with clear parts (like Contact Info, Summary, Work Done, School, Skills). Stay away from too much stuff, wild colors, or fancy letter styles. Keep headings, points, and space the same all through.
3. Select a Readable Font
Use neat, clear fonts like Arial or Times New Roman. Font size should be 10-12 points for the text and 14-16 points for titles. Keep the font style the same in the whole file.
4. Prioritize White Space
Use lots of blank space to make it easy to read and not too packed. Have margins of at least 0.5 inches (better if 0.75-1 inch) and put gaps or thin lines between parts to balance it out.
5. Organize with Clear Section Headings
Use bold, a bit bigger fonts for parts like “Work Done,” “School,” or “Skills.” Make sure all titles look the same and are lined up (like all to the left) to help guide the reader’s eyes.
6. Use Bullet Points for Clarity
Write job tasks, wins, and skills in short points, not long blocks. Start each point with a strong doing word (like “Built,” “Ran,” “Boosted”) and keep them short.

7. Tailor Content to the Job
Change your resume for each job by showing skills and work that match what the job asks for. Use words from the job post to get through systems and show you're a good fit.
8. Highlight Achievements with Metrics
Quantify your accomplishments whenever possible to demonstrate impact. For example, Where you can, use numbers to show what you've done. Like, instead of “Ran a team,” say “Ran a team of 8, made work 20% faster.” Numbers help picture your role.

9. Maintain Consistent Formatting
Make sure things like dates (like “Jan 2023 – Now”), point styles, and how lines line up stay the same. For example, all job titles to the left and use the same date set-up all through (like MM/YYYY).
10. Proofread and Save as a PDF
Look over your resume well to cut out typos or other small slips. Save the final version as a PDF to keep the look the same on all devices and work with systems.

By sticking to these layout tips, you can make a neat, pro resume that catches eyes and shows off your skills well. Shape your resume for each chance, keep it to the point, and let your skills do the talking to get your dream job!
