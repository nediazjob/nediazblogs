Your resume is your first chance to impress employers. A clear and <a href="https://nediaz.com/blog/how-to-write-a-resume">unique resume</a> can open doors to your next job. Here is how to make one that shines in just a few easy steps.
1. Match the Job
Shape your resume to fit the job you want. Read the job ad closely and use its words to show you’re the right fit. This helps your resume pass computer scans and catch the hiring managers eye.
2. Keep It Short and Sharp
Stick to one page with a clean design. Use simple fonts like Helvetica or Times New Roman and short bullet points. Make it easy to read at a glance.
3. Show Your Wins
Don not just list tasks share what you achieved. Start sentences with words like built,improved or solved and add numbers if you can (e.g., “Cut costs by 15%”). This proves your value.
4. Cover the Basics
Include these must-have sections:
Contact Info: Name, phone, email and LinkedIn link.
Quick Intro: 1-2 sentences about your skills and goals.
Experience: List recent jobs, dates, and key wins.
Education: Schools, degrees, and years.
Skills: Add abilities that match the job, like coding or teamwork.
5. Check for Mistakes
A typo can hurt your chances. Read your resume carefully and use a tool like Grammarly or ask a friend to spot errors. A clean resume shows you care.
6. Add Your Spark
Stand out by linking to a personal site or portfolio (like nediaz.com). This works great for jobs in design, tech or writing.
